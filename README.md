# Astro API starter

This repo is intended to serve a starting point for building API endpoints using Astro. It contains two routes in the `/api` directory to showcase how to use server side stuff. See [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/) for more info.

This starter uses the `@astrojs/vercel` SSR adapter because vercel is the easiest place to deploy APIs. This can be easily switched out to a different adapter.

## How to use

Use the GitHub's "Use this template" button at the top to initialize a new repo based on this.

OR...

Create an empty folder and run `npx degit mayank99/astro-api-starter`, then `git init`.

After that, feel free to make any changes. Probably want to update the `astro` version before running `npm install`.
